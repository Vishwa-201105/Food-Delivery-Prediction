# Food-Delivery-Prediction
#  Quick Commerce Delivery Time Prediction Dashboard    
A **Machine Learning + Streamlit** project that predicts food delivery times for quick commerce platforms (like Zepto, Swiggy, Zomato, Porter).    
This project uses **historical delivery data** and features such as **distance, preparation time, delivery person age, rating, order type, and vehicle type** to predict delivery times. 
The results are presented in an **interactive dashboard** built with Streamlit.    
---  ##  Features     
**Delivery Time Prediction** using ML model    
Interactive **Streamlit dashboard** with sliders & dropdowns    
Takes inputs like:      
- Distance (km)
- Preparation Time (mins)
- Delivery Person Age
- Delivery Person Rating
- Order Type
- Vehicle Type

Real-time **prediction output**
  - Professional **UI with dark theme**

##  Tech Stack    
- **Python 3.9+**
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas`, `numpy` → Data processing
  - `scikit-learn` → ML model training
  - `joblib` → Model saving/loading
